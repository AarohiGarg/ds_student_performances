## Problem Statement
The data provided is collected from a fully online nine-week-long course on machine learning, hosted on the online learning management system Moodle. Using this data, the goal is to use two different approaches (one a random forest classifier and one any other) to predict students’ final grade in the online course.

## Introduction
The dataset contains anonymized information relating to 107 enrolled students. The data includes students’ grades (from 3 mini projects, 3 quizzes and 3 peer reviews and the final overall grade) as well as the course logs.
Since in the given dataset, the final overall grade (our output) is provided, the type of machine learning applied will be Supervised Machine Learning.
Since the given dataset is categorical with Grades 0 to 5 being the six categories, this problem is an ideal example for implementing Classification Algorithms.
The classification algorithms being implemented in this project are: Random Forests Algorithm and Naïve Bayes Classifier Algorithm.
